## Smart-Parking-System
This is the project I chose to develop in the Junior To Medior Programme. I chose specifically this one since it is challenging to implement a workable system of such complexity by myself, which means I will gain a lot of experience from it.

### Introduction To Smart Parking System.
Smart Parking System is an application meant to be used by drivers who are in a dire need of a free parking slot. It will mainly be an mobile application which would allow drivers to take a look at a map which will contain all registered parkings in the system, with real-time data like number of free slots, total number of slots etc. The application will also allow them to book a parking slot for a symbolic fee. In case there is a private parking for a specific client, the system will have a web based SCADA system, from which the administration will be able to visualize the parking layout and status in real time.

### Why Smart Parking System?
Finding a free parking slot is a struggle, a bigger one if you are new to the city and you don't know where the hell are all the parkings. Also, even if you do know your city, it can still take time to find a place, since some spaces might be occupied, some parkings might be full and you are not aware of that. This has an impact on the fuel consumption of your car, the longer you search for a lot, the longer your car is working and burning fuel, which also has a great negative impact on the environment. A Smart Parking System could solve all this problems more or less. But it would make a driver's driving experience better.
